   <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Yes, I am online. What do you need?</p>
   <br>
   <p>Can you please update me on your stats?
   <ul>
      <li>DOS of Food:</li>
      <ol>
         <li> Potatoes: 13 Days </li>
         <li>Nappa Cabbages: 6 Days</li>
         <li>Dried Mussels: 9 Days</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <li>DOS of Water: 4 Days</li>
      <br>
      <li>DOS of other consumables?:</li>
      <ol>
         <li>Chewing Tobacco: 2 Days</li>
         <li>Ice Cream Cones: 5 Cones</li>
         <li>Bird food: 10 Days</li>
      </ol>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>As you see, my mussel supply will run out in 9 days! After that, I won't have any supply of iron so I will have to
      <em>eat the bird!</em>
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>On top of that, my water will run out soon too. But luckily I have my urine filtration system so I'll be OK for a
      while on that end.</p>
   <br>
   <p> Another problem, my main navigation display went out and I can't tell where I am. Can you tell me where I am?</p>
